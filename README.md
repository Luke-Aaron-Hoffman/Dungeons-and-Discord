# Dungeons and Discord

## What is it?

Dungeons and Discord is a bot for the online chat platform Discord that allows users to use UI elements of Discord along with text input to create characters for tabletop roleplaying games, and manage them with features such as stats and notes. It also has a dice roller that can work with a character and their stats.

## How does it work?

This code cannot be downloaded on its own and run itself. It requires the Discord.net Nugget package, and must be compiled with it to create an executable. This executable uses webhooks to connect to a bot set up by a user which then uses event listeners to run functions that allow character creation and management.

## Notes:

This particular bot is set up to work for "Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition", but it can be configured to work with any TRPG system, or even be system agnostic.
