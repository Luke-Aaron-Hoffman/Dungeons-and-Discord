# Dungeons and Discord

## What is it?

Dungeons and Discord is a bot for the online chat platform Discord that allows users to use UI elements of Discord along with text input to create characters for tabletop roleplaying games, and manage them with features such as stats and notes. It also has a dice roller that can work with a character and their stats.

## How does it work?

If you would like to see a working demo of this bot, you may [invite the bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=402305155959226380&scope=bot&permissions=1) to a Discord server to try it out. I always recommend setting up a new server for the sole purpose of testing new bots for safety reasons. To host the bot, download [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O5zTwCSP4bkPgCB8DVtMhgfCVnLAbkve/view?usp=sharing), extract the files, and run the DungeonsAndDiscord.exe file. When trying the bot out, type /help to learn how to use the bot.

## Notes:

This particular bot is set up to work for "Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition", but it can be configured to work with any TRPG system, or even be system agnostic.
